# film-cat
film-cat is a repository used for store FilmCat app which allows to categorize your watched and want-to-watch movies

One man project with main purposes - refreshing coding abilities (both in python and django) and making an easy to use, online database of movies that I've watched or I want to see.

One user for now. We'll see if I can manage to allow multiple acounts later.
